# Landing-Page
For the landing page project, I built a simple website for my beautiful country Kenya.<br>
As a beginner, I am proud of the outcome.<br>
I have incorporated different skills learned from the Odin project and my research.<br>
Now I am confident to work on more projects.<br>
Happy Coding!!
